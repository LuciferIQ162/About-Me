## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 **Math Explorer:** I love diving deep into mathematical concepts, especially limits, convergence, geometry, and logarithms. Whether it’s solving permutation-combination puzzles or exploring the beauty of rotational motion, math is my playground.
- 💻 **Code & Build:** I’m passionate about programming and constantly learning new tools. My current stack includes Python, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. I enjoy building machine learning models and automating data workflows.
- 🌐 **Web & Git:** I’m on a journey to master Git and GitHub, and I’m experimenting with building personal websites using modern tools and platforms. Sharing knowledge and projects is important to me.
- 🤖 **AI & Tech Curious:** I keep up with the latest advancements in AI, quantum computing, and emerging tech. I believe in the power of technology to transform the world.
- 🛠️ **Problem Solver:** I love tackling errors, debugging code, and finding efficient solutions—whether it’s fixing a Python ImportError, optimizing VS Code, or managing virtual environments.
- 🎯 **Goal-Oriented:** My ambition is to land a top tech job and contribute to impactful projects. I’m always open to collaboration and learning from the community.
- 🤖 **Robotics & Hardware:**  Robotics excites me because it lets me bring ideas to life with hardware and Python. I use microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, connecting sensors (ultrasonic, IR, gyroscope) and actuators (servos, DC motors) to build responsive systems. My workflow starts with breadboarding and wiring, then programming logic in Python—often managing dependencies with virtual environments and integrating TensorFlow for smart features. I love the hands-on process of testing, debugging, and refining each build until everything works seamlessly together.
